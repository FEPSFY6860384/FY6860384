          <style="font-family:calibri";> Chernobyl power station was the location of the world’s worst Nuclear disaster in 1986. The explosion of Reactor 4 was the result of a multitude of factors, some being malpractice at the hands of the engineers, 
          others being unforeseen errors that had a very negative effect on the reactor. This paper will be exploring all of those factors that resulted in the destruction of Reactor number 4.

       <p>
         <pre>
           <style="font-family:calibri";> The first problem Chernobyl had was concerning safety. There was a design flaw in the reactor that in the case of a power outage, the diesel backup generators wouldn’t immediately be 
            able to provide power to the reactor in order to keep it stable, they would only start providing power after 30 seconds. The theory was that the turbines spinning down could provide enough power to cover the 30 second transition 
            for the diesel generators to kick in and prevent any overload inside the reactor. These tests could only be performed under certain circumstances that were only available once a year. The plant had failed the previous two tests 
            in 1984 and 1985, leading to a lot of pressure on the operators going into the test on the 25th April 1986.

        <h3 id="Day of the Test">Day of the Test</h3>
          <p>
            <pre>
              <style="font-family:calibri";> On the scheduled day of the test, another problem arose. The coal powered plant near Pripyat had an outage, meaning that Chernobyl had to fill in the power in the meantime, so the test had 
              to be pushed back until the night. This was a problem because the staff working on the day shift were more experienced, and when the night staff came to the plant they had not been briefed that they would be carrying out the test.

        <h3 id="Xenon Poisoning">Xenon Poisoning</h3>
          <p>
            <pre>
             <style="font-family:calibri";> During the outage, the day staff had been preparing for the test, however due to the coal plant outage, the reactor had to be dialled up in order to provide the power to the grid. This rapid change in
             reactivity led to a build up of Xenon-135 inside the reactor. This phenomenon, known as Xenon poisoning, leads to a reactivity decrease over time, as Xenon-135 is a neutron absorber
