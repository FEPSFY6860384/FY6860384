        <pre>
          <style="font-family:calibri";> Chernobyl power station was the location of the world’s worst Nuclear disaster in 1986. The explosion of Reactor 4 was the result of a multitude of factors, some being malpractice at the hands of the engineers, 
          others being unforeseen errors that had a very negative effect on the reactor. This paper will be exploring all of those factors that resulted in the destruction of Reactor number 4.

       <p>
         <pre>
           <style="font-family:calibri";> The first problem Chernobyl had was concerning safety. There was a design flaw in the reactor that in the case of a power outage, the diesel backup generators wouldn’t immediately be able to provide power to 
            the reactor in order to keep it stable, they would only start providing power after 30 seconds. The theory was that the turbines spinning down could provide enough power to cover the 30 second transition for the diesel generators to kick in 
            and prevent any overload inside the reactor. These tests could only be performed under certain circumstances that were only available once a year. The plant had failed the previous two tests in 1984 and 1985, leading to a lot of pressure on 
            the operators going into the test on the 25th April 1986.
